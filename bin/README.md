#READ ME


A minimum value of samples with shared loci (min_samples_locus) of 1 was chosen so as not to discard the sequences from possible exclusive symbionts of one sample. The maximum value of different alleles in the consensus per sample (max_alleles_consens) was four and the value of maximum sites heterozygotes per locus (max_shared_Hs_locus) chosen was 0.5.


For each strategy, the .loci file generated by ipyrad, that presents the reads associated with each locus, was saved with the name of the individual from which the sample originated. The R script written by [Holmes and Rabosky, 2018](https://peerj.com/articles/4662/) was used to take the first sequence of each locus and group them into a fasta file that was later processed using the [blastn tool] (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download
) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).
