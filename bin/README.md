A minimum value of samples with shared loci (min_samples_locus) of 1 was chosen so as not to discard the sequences from possible exclusive symbionts of one sample. The maximum value of different alleles in the consensus per sample (max_alleles_consens) was four and the value of maximum sites heterozygotes per locus (max_shared_Hs_locus) chosen was 0.5.
